# Small-World Network Epidemic Dynamics with Adaptive Rewiring  
*Computational Modeling of Social Systems â€“ Final Project*
This project presents a computational simulation of epidemic dynamics on a small-world network using an extended Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) model with adaptive rewiring. The model explores how network structure and individual behavior affect the spread and control of infections.
